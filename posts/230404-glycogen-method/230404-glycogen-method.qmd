1. Collect 5 mL of biomass at designated timepoints and fix at 4C for at least 2 hours
  + Prepare 5 mL tubes beforehand with 0.2 mL of 37% paraformaldehyde
  + Put in walk in fridge for at least 2 hours per sample  
  
2. Decant excess formaldehyde liquid
  + Centrifuge for 10 minutes at 5000 rpm
  + Decant, then add 10 mL of DI to each tube
  + Mix up biomass and DI water with cell spreader
  + Save the remaining biomass for storage (centrifuge again and decant, then store in -20C freezer)  
  
3. Prepare digestion tubes
  + Pipette 0.5 mL of mixed biomass + DI into glass vials
  + Pipette 3 mL of 0.9 M HCl into each vial
  + Also prepare a blank with 1 mL DI + 2 mL HCl (same DI used for washing)  
  
4. Digest at 100C for 2 hours  

5. Cool in ice bath, then add 0.1 mL of 9 M NaOH to each tube to balance pH  

6. Prepare for glucose measurement via Sigma glucose absorbance kit 
  + Measure glucose concentration at 340 nm with 80 uL reagent, 30 uL sample
