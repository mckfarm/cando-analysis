This week I performed in-cycle sampling with glycogen analysis following up [last week's test run](/posts/230330-in-cycle/230330.qmd). The changes I made were increasing the number of samples taken for glycogen analysis and optimizing the glycogen extraction step for better glycogen recovery. The results this week look much better and follow an expected pattern of glycogen use and storage.

Note that I am still waiting to hear back about an N2O sensor head replacement - I have no idea if the order has been placed or when its supposed to arrive.

# In-cycle plots
## All data

A few observations: 

* The COD is consumed rapidly during the anaerobic phase, within about 15 minutes of starting the cycle test
* I technically dosed 40 mgCOD/L each of propionate and glucose but this isn't reflected in the measurements, possible due to incomplete mixing at the beginning of the test or rapid COD uptake.
* Not quite complete denitrification, but the influent COD:N was quite low (theoretically should have been 2:1).

## Glycogen profile

Let's take a closer look at the glycogen profile. The glycogen profile is interesting - intracellular glycogen seems to increase slightly during the anaerobic phase, then decrease by the end of the phase. I think the increase in glycogen during the anaerobic phase could be attributed to the glucose from the influent feed. Glycogen seems to be replenished during the anoxic and aerobic phases, which is expected behavior for a PAO/GAO culture. 

```{r carbon plot}

ylim_custom <- 10

# dynamic phase lines

phase_labs <- list(
  annotate("text", x = mean(phase_times$t0[1:2]), y = ylim_custom, label = "anaerobic"),
  annotate("text", x = mean(phase_times$t0[2:3]), y = ylim_custom, label = "anoxic"),
  annotate("text", x = mean(c(phase_times$t0[3], max(df$hour))), y = ylim_custom, label = "aerobic")
)

# pull colors and shapes
plot_list <- c("glycogen") # this has to be in order

plot_palette <- palette_df %>% filter(vars %in% plot_list)

custom_color <- scale_color_manual(name="Constituent",
                                   values=plot_palette$colors,
                                   labels=plot_palette$labels)

custom_shape <- scale_shape_manual(name="Constituent",
                                   values=plot_palette$shapes,
                                   labels=plot_palette$labels)

df %>% filter(variable %in% plot_list) %>%
  ggplot(data=.,aes(x=hour, y=value, color=variable, shape=variable)) +
  geom_point(size=2.5, alpha = 0.9) +
  custom_color +
  custom_shape +
  phase_lines + 
  phase_labs + 
  theme_defaults + 
  ylim(3, ylim_custom) + 
  labs(y="Concentration\n[mgGlycogen/gBiomass]", x="Hour")

# Maximum removal rates

Maximum removal rates are calculated from the linear parts of the nutrient or carbon profile. Rates are normalized to solids measurements. 

## Denitrification rate

The denitrification rate was steady over the entire anoxic period, and nitrite was mostly depleted by the end of the phase. 

```{r denit rates}

anx_denit_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "anx", "nitrite", 4, solids)

```

The maximum denitrification rate is **`r anx_denit_rate` mgN/gTSS/hour**. 


## P release and uptake rates

The P release rate was rapid during the anaerobic phase, corresponding with a very quick glucose and propionate uptake rate. The P uptake was steady over both the anoxic and aerobic phases.

```{r P release and uptake rates}

ana_phos_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "ana", "phosphate", 3, solids)
anx_phos_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "aer", "phosphate", 6, solids)
aer_phos_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "aer", "phosphate", 4, solids)

```

The maximum phosphate release rate is **`r ana_phos_rate` mgP/gTSS/hour**.   
The maximum anoxic phosphorus uptake rate is **`r anx_phos_rate` mgP/gTSS/hour**.  
The maximum aerobic phosphorus uptake rate is **`r aer_phos_rate` mgP/gTSS/hour**.  


## Carbon uptake rates

One thing to note with the C uptake rates is that I had dosed ~40 mgCOD/L each of glucose and propionate, but the measured concentrations are a bit below this. 


```{r C uptake rates}

ana_prop_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "ana", "propionate", 3, solids)
ana_glu_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "ana", "glucose", 2, solids)

```

The maximum propionate uptake rate is **`r ana_prop_rate` mgCOD/gTSS/hour**.
The maximum glucose uptake rate is **`r ana_glu_rate` mgCOD/gTSS/hour**.



```{r save rates to csv}
rates_df <- tibble(rate = c("ana_phos", "anx_phos", "aer_phos", "anx_denit", "ana_prop"),
                   value = c(ana_phos_rate, anx_phos_rate, aer_phos_rate, anx_denit_rate, ana_prop_rate),
                   )

# also save some important info - starting COD, N, P
rates_df <- append_rates_df(rates_df, df, choose_date)

saveRDS(rates_df, file = here("data", paste0("rates-", choose_date, ".RDS")))

```
