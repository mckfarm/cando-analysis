This week I tested the glycogen extraction and measurement with some in-cycle samples. Samples for glycogen analysis were collected during the anaerobic and anoxic phases of the reactor cycle. A rough draft of the protocol used for the glycogen extraction and measurement can be found [here](/posts/230330-glycogen-test/230330-glycogen-test.qmd).

# In-cycle plots

## Nutrient profile

Here is the phosphorus and nitrite profile over the sampling period. Note that the nitrate concentration was minimal so was excluded from this plot. 

```{r in-cycle plot}

## plotting params - phase labels and lines
ylim_custom <- round(max(df$value, na.rm = TRUE) + 10, 0)

# dynamic phase lines
phase_times <- df %>% group_by(phase) %>% summarise(t0 = min(hour))

phase_lines <- list(
  geom_vline(xintercept = filter(phase_times, phase == "anx")$t0, color="grey"))


phase_labs <- list(
  annotate("text", x = mean(phase_times$t0[1:2]), y = ylim_custom, label = "anaerobic"),
  annotate("text", x = mean(c(phase_times$t0[2], max(df$hour))), y = ylim_custom, label = "anoxic")
)


# pull colors and shapes
plot_list <- c("phosphate", "nitrite") # this has to be in order

plot_palette <- palette_df %>% filter(vars %in% plot_list)

custom_color <- scale_color_manual(name="Constituent",
                                   values=plot_palette$colors,
                                   labels=plot_palette$labels)

custom_shape <- scale_shape_manual(name="Constituent",
                                   values=plot_palette$shapes,
                                   labels=plot_palette$labels)

df %>% filter(variable %in% plot_list) %>%

```

## Carbon profile

This is the COD profile over the same time period. Glucose was not added to this in=cycle test. Note that the glycogen concentration is reported as **mg glucose as COD/g biomass**. This profile does not follow the expected glycogen profile of PAO and GAO, where glycogen would be depleted in the anaerobic phase and replenished in the anoxic phase. I am going to try the measurement again this coming week with a few adjustments - the protocol I used this week can be found [here](https://mckennafarmer.notion.site/Glycogen-testing-d78b170286494ce695053984b7ba05c2). 

Adjustments for Monday, April 3rd: 

* Add biomass into the digestion tube to produce a final digestion ratio of 1 mg biomass per 1 mL 0.9 M HCl. My ratio ended up being closer to 0.35 mg biomass per 1 mL 0.9 M HCl, so glycogen may not have been hydrolysed completely in all samples.
* Take biomass samples from the aerobic phase. I only took samples from the anaerobic and anoxic phases to test the method with fewer samples, so I will add aerobic timepoints to better understand the complete glycogen profile. 



```{r glycogen plot}

df_gly <- df %>% filter(variable == "glycogen")

# calculate mg glycogen/g biomass
df_gly$value <- df_gly$value * 3 / (solids$TSS * 0.015 / 0.010)

df_carbon <- rbind(df_gly, subset(df, variable == "propionate"))

ylim_custom <- 20 # have to manually mess with this with the dual y axis

phase_labs <- list(
  annotate("text", x = mean(phase_times$t0[1:2]), y = ylim_custom, label = "anaerobic"),
  annotate("text", x = mean(c(phase_times$t0[2], max(df$hour))), y = ylim_custom, label = "anoxic")
)

plot_list <- c("propionate", "glycogen")

plot_palette <- palette_df %>% filter(vars %in% plot_list)

custom_color <- scale_color_manual(name="Constituent",
                                   values=plot_palette$colors,
                                   labels=plot_palette$labels)

custom_shape <- scale_shape_manual(name="Constituent",
                                   values=plot_palette$shapes,
                                   labels=plot_palette$labels)


df_carbon %>% filter(variable %in% plot_list) %>%
    ggplot(data=., aes(x=hour, y=value, color = variable, shape = variable)) +
    geom_point(size=2.5) +
    phase_lines +
    phase_labs + 
    custom_color + 
    custom_shape + 
    theme_defaults +
    labs(y="COD concentration\n[mgCOD/L or mgCOD/gBiomass]", x="Hour")

# Maximum rate calculations
Maximum removal rates are calculated from the linear parts of the nutrient or carbon profile. Rates are normalized to solids measurements. 

## Denitrification rate

```{r denit rates}

anx_denit_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "anx", "nitrite", 4, solids)

```

The maximum denitrification rate is **`r anx_denit_rate` mgN/gTSS/hour**. 


## P release and uptake rates
```{r P release and uptake rates}

ana_phos_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "ana", "phosphate", 3, solids)
anx_phos_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "anx", "phosphate", 4, solids)

```

The maximum phosphate release rate is **`r ana_phos_rate` mgP/gTSS/hour**.   
The maximum anoxic phosphorus uptake rate is **`r anx_phos_rate` mgP/gTSS/hour**.  

## Carbon uptake rates
```{r C uptake rates}

ana_prop_rate <- get_max_rate(df, "ana", "propionate", 3, solids)

```

The maximum propionate uptake rate is **`r ana_prop_rate` mgCOD/gTSS/hour**.


```{r save rates to csv}

rates_df <- tibble(rate = c("ana_phos", "anx_phos", "aer_phos", "anx_denit", "ana_prop", "ana_glu"),
                   value = c(ana_phos_rate, anx_phos_rate, NA, anx_denit_rate, ana_prop_rate, NA),
                   )


# also save some important info - starting COD, N, P
rates_df <- append_rates_df(rates_df, df, choose_date)# specifying here since glycogen is listed as glucose for plotting purposes, maybe retool this later

saveRDS(rates_df, file = here("data", paste0("rates-", choose_date, ".RDS")))

```
